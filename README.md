# 1. Motivation

1. Learning Angular and Typescript
2. Being prepared for an eventual Yes from Adstate
3. Showing another proof of motivation and proactivity to them

# 2. Process

## 2.1. Redesign

I noticed a number of accessibility issues on the website:

1. A bunch of unsufficient contrasts, for example the buttons:

2. Some weirdly aligned elements like on the mobile header:
